### 0.1.0

_Released 2024 Dec 04_

#### Overview

This plugin is a library of tasks for working with the JDK tools that did not
make it into Gradle itself yet. As such, it provides the foundational building
blocks for working with `jlink`, `jpackage`, and more.

The plugin does not register and tasks or extensions, or modifies the project in
any way. If you are looking for an out-of-the-box solution, this is not the
right plugin for you.
